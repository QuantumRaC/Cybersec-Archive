# Network & Protocols

## Network Models

- **OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)**: theoretical framework for computer network comms
  - *Please Do Not Touch Sam's Private Area.*
    1. **Physical Layer** - physical connection between devices
        - e.g. cables
    2. **Data link layer** - data transfer protocol between adjacent nodes
        - network segment: a group of networked devices using a shared medium / channel of comms
        - e.g. Ethernet, WiFi
    3. **Network layer** - logical addressing & routing between networks
        - e.g. IP, ICMP, VPN protocols (IPSec, SSL/TLS)
    4. **Transport layer** - comms between running apps on different hosts
        - end-to-end comms & data segmentation
        - e.g. TCP, UDP
    5. **Session layer** - establishing, maintaining & syncing comms between apps on different hosts
        - e.g. NFS, RPC
    6. **Presentation layer** - data encoding, compression, & encryption for Layer 7 to understand
        - e.g. ASCII / Unicode
    7. **Application layer** - provides network services to end-user apps
        - e.g. HTTP, FTP, DNS, POP3, SMTP, IMAP

- **TCP/IP** (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) Model
  - allows a network to function with parts out of service
  - maps to the OSI model:
    2. (Data) Link Layer
    3. Internet (Network) Layer
    4. Transport Layer
    5,6,7. Application Layer

## Addresses


- **IP Address**
  - IPv4: most common, default
  - 4 octets, each 8 bits (0~255)
    - x.x.x.0 reserved for network address
    - x.x.x.255 reserved for broadcast address (targets all hosts on network)
  - **subnet mask** of 255.255.255.0 can be written as /24 (leftmost 24 bits of the IP doesn't change across the subnet)
  - **Private addresses** - isolated from the outside world; to access Internet the router must have a public IP addr and support [**NAT** (Network Address Translation)](#nat-network-address-translation)
    - 10.0.0.0 ~ 10.255.255.255 (10/8)
    - 172.16.0.0 ~ 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12)
    - 192.168.0.0 ~ 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16)

- **MAC address (Media Access Control)**
  - 6 bytes hexadecimal
  - Ethernet / WiFi addresses
  - first three - vendor who build the network interface
  - last three - unique address of the network interface

- **Port number**
  - 2 octets
  - port 0 is reserved


## Processes

- **Routing**
  - functions at layer 3
  - inspects IP addr, forwards packet to the best network (router) so packet gets closer to destination
  - see [routing algorithms](#routing-algorithms)

- **Encapsulation**
  - the process of every layer adding a header / trailer to the received unit of data and sending the encapsulated unit to layer below
    1. Transport layer adds TCP / UDP Header to application data, creating a TCP segment / UDP datagram
    2. Network layer adds IP header
    3. Data link layer adds proper Ethernet / WiFi header & trailer (frame)

### Layer 2 (Data Link)

- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**
  - allows translation from layer 3 to 2 addressing
  - finds MAC addr of IP addr
  - makes it possible to find MAC addr of another device on the Ethernet
    - `arp-scan` only works if yoiur deviec is connected to the samenetwork (i.e. over Ethernet or Wifi)
    - originally Ethernet packets need MAC addr as destination & src
  - machine sends ARP request from MAC addr to broadcast MAC addr, to ask for the other to respond with its MAC addr
  - not encapsulated within UDP or IP packet; directly encapsulated within Ethernet frame

### Layer 3 (Network)

- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**
  - network diagnostics & error reporting
  - commands that use ICMP
    - `ping` uses ICMP; measures round-trip time (RTT)
    - `traceroute` (linux) / `tracert` (Windows) uses ICMP to discover route from host to target; requires TTL field to become 0

- **NAT (Network Address Translation)**
  - uses one public IP addr to provide access to many private IP addrs
  - routers supporting NAT needs to track ongoing connections, & maintain a table translating network addrs between internal (generally private) & external (generally public) networks

- **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**
  - solution to ensure all data leaving / entering computer is protected from disclosure & alteration
  - internet traffic will usually be routed all over the VPN tunnel
  - accessed services and web apps don't see your public IP addr but the VPN server's, and local ISP only see encrypted traffic - cannot censor internet access

### Layer 4 (Transport)

- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**
  - allows reaching to specific processes on target host
  - connectionless protocol operating 
  - layer 4 (transport layer)
  - 65,536 ports
  - does not even know if the packet has been delivered
  - a UDP data unit that encapsulates the app data is a *UDP datagram*.

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
  - connection-oriented (required TCP connection) transport protocol
  - layer 4
  - 65,536 ports
  - each data octet has a sequence number - receiver can identify lost / duplicated packets, and acknowledge reception by specifying last received octet
  - TCP Connection
    - requires a **three-way handshake**
    1. *SYN Packet*: client initiates connection by sending SYN packet to server, containing client's random initial sequence number
    2. *SYN-ACK Packet*: server responds to SYN Packet with SYN-ACK, adds server's random initial sequence number 
    3. *ACK Packet*: client sends ACK Packet to acknowledge reception of SYN-ACK
  - A TCP data unit that encapsulates the app data is a *TCP segment*.

### Layer 5-7 (Application)

#### Remote Access

- **TELNET (Teletype Network)**
  - a network protocol for remote terminal connection
  - can be used to connect to any server *listening on a TCP port number*
  - `telnet x.x.x.x [port]` connects to specific port
  - *Echo server* - listens on **port 7**, server echoes everything you send
  - *Daytime server* - listens on **port 13**, replies with current day and time
  - *Web server* - listens on **port 80**, serves web pages
    - `GET / HTTP/1.1` gets the host
    - `GET /web.html` gets the page

- **SSH (Secure Shell)**
  - a cryptographic network protocol for secure communication between edvices
  - encrypts data using crypto algorithms (e.g. [AES](#aes-advanced-encryption-system)) when sent over a network (e.g. Internet)
  - SSH keys are RSA keys by default
  - often used when logging in remotely to a computer or server
  - some benefits:
    > secure authentication - supports public key & two-factor auth
    > confidentiality - OpenSSH provides end-to-end encryption & notifies you of new server keys to protect man-in-the-middle attacks
    > integrity - cryptography protects integrity of traffic
    > tunneling - creates a VPN-like connection to route other protocols through SSH
    > X11 forwarding - allows unix-like gui application over the network
  - for `ssh` command usage see [`ssh`](linux_notes.md#networks)
  - key pairs generated by `ssh-keygen` program; supports various algorithms
    - generates private key (e.g. id_rsa or id_ed25519) and public key (e.g. id_rsa.pub or id_ed25519.pub)
    - when generating an SSH key to log into a remotemachine, you should generate the key on local machine and copy the public key over using `ssh-copy-id` - private key should never exist on the target machine.
    - tools to attack an encrypted SSH key to try find the passphrase - *John the Rupper*
    - authorization process:
    1. server sends a challenge that can only be correctly solved by someone with the private key
    2. SSH client uses private key (may need to be unlocked with passphrase) to solve the challenge
    3. server verifies the solution using the public key it has


#### Network Services

- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**
  - level 7  protocol that relies on UDP (**port 67** for server, **port 68** for client)
  - automated way to configure devices connected to the server
  - four steps (*DORA*):
    1. *Discover* - broadcases DHCPDISCOVER message seeking the local DHCP server if exists
        - sends to broadcast addr
    2. *Offer* - server responds with a DHCPOFFER message with an IP addr available for client to accept
    3. *Request* - client responds with DHCPREQUEST message indicating accepting the offered IP
    4. *Acknowledge* - server responds with DHCPACK to confirm the offered IP addr being assigned to client
        - client changes addrb from no IP configuration to accepted IP
  - DHCP provides
    - leased IP addr to access network resources
    - gateway to route packets outside local network
    - a DNS server to resolve domain names

- **DNS (Domain Name Server)**
  - layer 7
  - UDP **port 53**, TCP **port 53**
  - many types of DNS records
    1. A record: hostname -> one or more IPv4 addresses
    2. AAAA record: similar to A, but for IPv6
    3. CNAME (canonical name) record: domain name -> another domain name
    4. MX (mail exchange) record: specifies mail server responsible for handling emails for a domain
  - **WHOIS records** 
    - information of domain domain owners
    - can be looked up using `whois [url]`

#### Web

- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**
  - relies on TCP, usually TCP **port 80** and 443, sometimes 8080 and 8443
  - designed to retrieve web pages
- **HTTPS**
  - HTTP over [TLS](#tls)
  1. TCP three-way handshake with target server
  2. establishes TLS session
  3. communicate via HTTP (e.g. issue requests) 

#### File / Email Transfer

- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**
  - TCP **port 21**
  - higher speed than HTTP when all conditions equal
  - `ftp [ip]` -> log in -> `type ascii` -> `ls` / `get file.txt` downloads file to root
- **FTPS**
  - TCP **port 990**
  - requires cert setup
  
- **SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)**
  - TCP **port 22**
  - part of the [SSH](#ssh-secure-shell) protocol suite
  - `sftp username@hostname` to log in; use FTP commands to download/upload files

- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**
  - TCP **port 25**
    - `HELO`/`EHLO` initiates SMTP session
    - `MAIL FROM: <user@client.thm>` specifies sender's email addr
    - `RCPT TO: <user@client.thm>` specifies recipient's email addr
    - `DATA` indicates beginning sending mail content
    - `.` send on newline to indicate end of email message
- **SMTPS**
  - TCP **port 465 & 587**
  - SMTP + TLS

- **POP3 (Post Office Protocol v3)**
  - TCP **port 110**
  - designed to allow client to comm with a mail server & retrieve email - email client sends by SMTP and retrieves using POP3
  - attempts to minimize server storage as email is downloaded & deleted from remote server
    - `USER <username>` identifies user
    - `PASS <password>` provides user's password
    - `STAT` requests # messages & total size
    - `LIST` lists all messages & sizes
    - `RETR <message_number>` retrieves specified message
    - `DELE <message_number>` marks message for deletion
    - `QUIT` ends POP3 session & applies changes
- **POP3S**
  - TCP **port 995**
  - POP3 + TLS

- **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)**
  - TCP **port 143**
  - allows synchronizing read, moved, & deleted messages; convenient for checking via multiple clients
    - `LOGIN <username> <password>` authenticates user
    - `SELECT <mailbox>` selects mailbox folder to work with
    - `FETCH <mail_number> <data_item_name>` e.g. `FETCH 3 body[]`
    - `MOVE <sequence_set> <mailbox>` moves specified message to another mailbox
    - `COPY <sequence_set> <data_item_name>` copies specified message to another mailbox
    - `LOGOUT` logs out
- **IMAPS**
  - TCP **port 993**
  - IMAP + TLS

#### Security / Encryption

<a name="tls"> </a>

- **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**
  - layer 6
  - cryptographic protocol that allows secure (confidential & intact) comms between client and server over insecure network
  - upgrade of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) in 1999
  - *TLS certificate*:
    > server admin creates Certificate Signing Request, submits to Certificate Authority; 
    > CA verifies CSR & issues digital cert; 
    > signed cert can be used to identify the server or client to others
    > signed cert must be installed on host for host to confirm its validity
  - packets are encrypted, need access to private key
  - only changes HTTP; TCP and IP are not modified
  - `chromium -- ssl-key-log-file =~/ssl-key.log`
    - dumps TLS keys to ssl-key.log file
    - the file will contain pre-master secrets for each SSL/TLS session Chrome initiates
    - keys can be used to decrypt HTTPS traffic in Wireshark

## Routing Algorithms

- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**
  - has routers exchange updates about states of their connected links & networks
  - each router has complete map of network and determines the best routes

- **EIGRP (Enhance Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)**
  - Cisco proprietary routing protocol
  - allows routers to share info about networks they can reach & cost (bandwidth, delay, etc.)
  - routers use info to choose most efficient paths

- **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**
  - primary routing protocol on the Internet
  - allows ISPs exchange routing info & establish paths
  - ensures data is routed efficiently even between networks

- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**
  - simple protocol used often in small networks
  - routers share information about networks they can reach & number of hops (routers) required
  - each router builds a routing table and chooses routes with fewest hops
