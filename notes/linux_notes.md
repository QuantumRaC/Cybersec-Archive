# Linux Notes & Resources

# (Very) Basic Commands

- `ls`
  - lists the contents of the working directory
  - `ls -a` (`-a` is short for `--all`) shows hidden folders (those that beging with `.`)
  - `-h` for human readeable format
  - `-l` for long output including read-write permissions and dates
    - e.g.
        hacker@dojo:~$ ls -l
        total 4
        -rw-r--r-- 1 hacker hacker    0 May 22 13:42 college_file
        drwxr-xr-x 2 hacker hacker 4096 May 22 13:42 pwn_directory
      - file type
        - first character - file type; `d` - directory, `-` - normal file; `c` for character device (device file, sych as display output)
      - permissions
        - 3 characters for owner user permission
        - 3 for group (that owns the file)
        - 3 for all other (users and groups) access
        > `r` - user/group/other can read the file (or list the directory)
        > `w` - user/group/other can modify the files (or create/delete files in the directory)
        > `x` - user/group/other can execute the file as a program (or can enter the directory, e.g., using `cd`)
        > `-` - nothing 
      - ownership information
        - user that owns the file
        - group that owns the file

- `id`
  - shows user name and id and group names and ids of current user

- `chown`
  - `chown [username] [file]` changes ownership of file
  - typically can only be invoked by the root user
- `chgrp`
  - `chgrp [username] [file]` changes group ownership

- `chmod`
  - `chmod [OPTIONS] MODE FILE`
  - MODE: WHO+/-WHAT
    - WHO
      - `u` for owning user
      - `g` for owning group
      - `o` for others
      - `a` for all
    - WHAT
      - `w` for write
      - `r` for read
      - `x` for execute

- `touch`
  - `touch newFile` creates newFile under current dir

- `mkdir`
  - `mkdir mydirectory` creates mydirectory under current dir

- `rm`
  - `rm file` removes file; `rm -R directory` removes directory

- `cp`&`scp`
  - (securely) copies the entire contents of an existing file into a new file
  - `cp note note2` copies note to note2
  - `scp user@10.10.10.10:8000/home/user/doc.txt notes.txt` copies file from remote computer (not logged into)'s port 8000 to local notes.txt

- `mv`
  - instead of creating a new file, the original file is merged
  - can be used to move or rename file/folders
  - `mv file1 file2` renames file1 to file2

- `file`
  - determines file type
  - `file note` -> `note: ASCII text`

- `find`
    - e.g. `find -name name.txt`
    - outputs `/dir/name.txt`
    - finds file with name / chosen extension

- `grep`
    - e.g. `grep "word" name.txt` searches for "word" within name.txt
    - outputs selected entry with "word" highlighted
    - `-v`  invert match - shows everything that doesn't match the keyword

- `wc`
    - e.g. `wc name.txt` returns wordcound of name.txt
    - outputs `100 name.txt`
    - word count

- `ln`
  - `ln -s linked_path new_path` links new_path to original file
  - creates symbolic links
    - hard link: when multiple files are all addresses that indexes the same data
    - soft link (symbolic link): contains the original file name; when accessed, Linux realizes that it is a symbolic link and reads the original file name, and typically automatically accesses that file.

- shell variables
  - `echo $NAME` prints out the variable with name NAME
  - `NAME=value` sets variable NAME to value
  - `NAME=$(cat /flag)` reads the output of the function into the variable
  - `read -p "INPUT PROMPT: " NAME` reads the input after INPUT PROMPT into NAME

- `tr`
  - `echo TEXT | tr T N` translates TEXT to NEXT
  - `echo TEXT | tr -d E` translates TEXT to TXT

- `cut`
  - `cut -d " " -f 1 input.txt` cuts the 1st column of input.txt by delimiter " "


# Processes
- for concept see [processes](notes.md#processes) 

- `ps`
  - provides list of running processes as current user's session
  - additional info (status code, session, CPU usage time, name of command being executed)
  - `ps aux` allows viewing processes run by other users & those that don't run from a session (i.e. system processes)
  - STAT
    - `S` - sleeping while waiting for input
    - `T` - suspended
    - `R` - actively running

- `top`
  - real-time stats about processes running on system
  - refreshes once every 10 seconds / when using arrow keys to browse

- `kill`
  - `kill 1337` kills PID 1337
  - signals to send to process when it's killed:
    - `SIGTERM` kills but allow it to do some cleanup tasks beforehand
    - `SIGKILL` kills and doesn't do any cleanup
    - `SIGSTOP` stops / suspends a process

- Ctrl-C interrupts processes
- Ctrl-Z suspends processes
- `fg`
  - brings the background process back into use (foreground) on the terminal

- `systemctl`
  - allows interaction with the systemd process / daemon
  - `systemctl [option] [service]`
    - options: `start`, `stop`, `enable`, `disable`
    - `start` and `stop` switches it on and off immediately but does not affect auto-start at boot
    - `enable` and `disable` doesn't immediately switch it on and off but enables / disables auto-start at boot


- `crontab`
  - used to schedule repetitive tasks via the `cron` daemon
  - jobs are defined in a crontab file using a 5-field time format followed by the command:
    - `* * * * * command`
    - `â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ day of week (0-7, Sunday = 0 or 7)`
    - `â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€â”€â”€ month (1-12)`
    - `â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ day of month (1-31)`
    - `â”‚ â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ hour (0-23)`
    - `â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ minute (0-59)`
  - use `crontab -e` to edit the current user's crontab
  - `crontab -l` to list scheduled tasks
  - `crontab -r` to remove
  - e.g. `0 2 * * * /home/user/backup.sh` runs backup script every day at 2:00 AM at the timezone & time of the machine
  - `@reboot command` runs at reboot
  - See conceptual overview in [notes.md â€“ cron / crontab](notes.md#cron--crontab)



# Users

- `su`
  - switches between users
  - need password unless you are the root user
  - `su username` switches to username
  - `sudo su` becomes root user

# Networks

- `ssh`
  - e.g. `ssh racc@10.10.10.10` logs in as user racc with target IP using [SSH](network_notes.md#ssh-secure-shell)
  - runs on **port 22**
  - `ssh hostname` if username is same as logged-in username
  - argument `-X` required to support running graphical interfaces
  
- `ssh-keygen`
  - `-t <type>`  
    - specify key type (`rsa`, `ed25519`, `ecdsa`, etc.)  
    e.g. `ssh-keygen -t ed25519` â†’ generates `id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519.pub`
  - `-C <comment>`  
  - attach a comment to the public key (often your email)  
    e.g. `ssh-keygen -C "me@domain.com"` â†’ appends comment to `.pub` file
  - `-f <filename>`  
  - define output file name (without extension)  
    e.g. `ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/my_key` â†’ generates `my_key` and `my_key.pub`
  - `-N <passphrase>`  
  - set a passphrase non-interactively  
    e.g. `ssh-keygen -N "securepass"` â†’ sets passphrase directly
  - `-q`  
  - quiet mode â€“ suppress output  
    e.g. `ssh-keygen -q -t rsa` â†’ generates key silently
  - `-y`  
  - extract public key from a private key  
    e.g. `ssh-keygen -y -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa` â†’ prints public key to stdout
  - `-e`  
  - convert OpenSSH public key to RFC4716 format  
    e.g. `ssh-keygen -e -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` â†’ outputs RFC4716 format
  - `-m <format>`  
  - specify key format (`RFC4716`, `PKCS8`, `PEM`)  
    e.g. `ssh-keygen -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa` â†’ saves key in PEM format
  - `-l`  
  - show fingerprint of a key file  
    e.g. `ssh-keygen -l -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`  
    â†’ `2048 SHA256:abc...xyz me@domain.com (RSA)`

- `telnet`
  - see [Telnet](network_notes.md#telnet)

- `wget`
  - allows downloading files from the web via HTTP
  - `wget https://url/file.txt`
  - `wget -O output.txt https://file.txt`

- `nmap`
  - stands for **Network Mapper**
  - open source tool for network discovery and security auditing
    - scans hosts and networks to discover open ports, running services, OS info, and firewall rules
  - useful for diagnostics, network mapping, and security auditing
  - *when `nmap <ip>` with local user privilege, does connect scan*
  - **Verbosity** - `-v`, `-vv`, `-vvv` etc. to produce more verbose output
    - `-d` for debugging level output; max `-d9`
  - specifying targets:
    - IP range with `-`
    - IP subnet using `/` (i.e. `192.168.0.1/24` would be equivalent to `192.168.0.0-255`)
  - scans most common 1000 ports by default.
    - `-F` scans 100 to be faster
    - `-p[range]` allows scanning a specific range (e.g. `-p10-1024`, `-p-25`; `-p-` or `-p1-65535` scans all)
  - Common usage:
    - `-sn <ip-range>` â€“ *ping scan*, shows which hosts are online
      - displays MAC addr of hosts if connected to local network
    - `-sL <ip>` - *displays all targets* to scan without actually scanning them
    - **Port scans**
      - `-sT <ip>` - tests for open ports: *connect scans* by trying to complete the TCP handshake with every target TCP port
      - `-sS <ip>` - *SYN scan* (only sends a TCP SYN packet and doesn't complete the handshake); more stealthy
      - `-sU <ip>` - *UDP scan*
      - *we can use `-Pn` to ask Nmap to treat all hosts as online and port scan every host* (sometimes the target host doesn't reply to ICMP requests during host discovery and Nmap will mark this host as down)
  - **Detection**
    - `-o <ip>` â€“ enables OS detection
    - `-sV <ip>` â€“ enables service version detection
    - `-A` - altogether enables OS detection, version scanning, and traceroute, etc.
  - **Timing** - to prevent triggering IDS
    - paranoid (0), sneaky (1), polite (2), normal(default) (3), aggressive (4), insane (5) - slowest to fastest
      - different waiting time when moving from port to port
    - i.e. `-T0`, `-T 0` or `-T paranoid`
    - Parallelism
      - `--min-parallelism <numprobes>` & `--max-parallelism <numprobes>` - sets min/max simultaneously active TCP and UDP port probes
        - by default auto managed (i.e. less probes for poor network)
    - Rate
      - `--min-rate <number>` & `--max-rate <number>` - controls min and max rates that nmap sends packets in packets per second
    - `--host-timeout <time>` - specifies max time you are willing to wait
  - **Saving results**
    - `-oN <filename>` - normal output
    - `-oX <filename>` - XML output
    - `-oG <filename>` - `grep`able output (for `grep` and `awk`)
    - `-oA <basename>` - output in all major formats (extensions nmap, xml, and gnmap)

- `nslookup [url]`
  - looks up the domain's IP addr

- `ip address show`
  - `ip a s` - lists the available network interfaces

- `libpcap` library
  - `tcpdump`
    - basic packet capture
      - `-i INTERFACE` - listens to a specific interface; or `-i any` `-i eth0`
        - `ip`/`ip6`/`udp`/`tcp`/`icmp` - add protocol name after `INTERFACE` to filter by protocol
      - `-w FILE` - saves captures packets to file (.pcap)
      - `-r FILE` - reads packets from a file
      - `-c COUNT` - specifies the number of packets to capture; without specifying, it continues til interruption
      - `-n` - stops resolving IP addr with DNS lookup
        - `-nn` stops both DNS and port number lookup (resolves port number into port name (e.g. 80 to http))
      - `-v` - to produce a slightly more verbose output; adds TTL, identification, total length & options in IP packets, etc.
        - `-vv` is more verbose, `-vvv` even more verbose
      - `host IP`/`host HOSTNAME` - e.g. example.com - listens to packets exchanged with specific host
        - `src host IP`/`src host HOSTNAME` or `dst host IP`/`dst host HOSTNAME`
      - `port PORT_NUMBER` - filters by port
        - `src port PORT_NUMBER` or `dst port PORT_NUMBER`
    - **logical arguments (and, or, not) work in `tcpdump`.**
    - filtering
      - `greater LENGTH`/`less LENGTH` - filters packets with greater or equal to / less than or equal to specified length
      - **header bytes**:
        - tcp allows referring to contents of any byte in the header with `proto[expr:size]` 
          - (proto is protocol; expr indicates byte offset starting at 0; size (optional) is the number of bytes we want to examine)
          - can use binary operations
          - `tcp[tcpflags]` refer to the TCP flags field
            - `tcpflags` i.e. `tcp-syn`, `tcp-ack`, `tcp-fin`, `tcp-rst`, `tcp-push`
          - e.g. `tcpdump "tcp[tcpflags] == tcp-syn` captures TCP packets with only the SYN flag set and all other flags unset
            - `tcpdump "tcp[tcpflags] & (tcp-syn|tcp-ack) != 0"` captures TCP packets with at least the SYN or ACK flag set
    - displaying packets
      - `-q` quick output that prints timestamp, src and dst IP addr & port number
      - `-e` prints link-level header (i.e. includes MAC addr in output)
      - `-A` shows packet data in ASCII
      - `-xx` shows packet data in hex
      - `-X` shows packet headers and data in hex and ASCII

# Operators

- operator `&`
    - runs the command in background

- operator `&&`
    - `command1 && command2` runs command2 only if command1 is successful

- operator `>`
    - redirects output of a command to a file; overwrites contents if file already exists
    - e.g. `echo newText > file` writes contents of file as "newText"

- operator `>>`
    - also an output redirector but instead appends output at the bottom of the file
    - e.g. `echo newLine >> file` adds "newLine" at the bottom of file without replacing its contents

# Shells

- `echo $SHELL` shows which shell you're using
  - `/etc/shells` contains all installed shells on a Linux system
  - `.chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh` permanently changes default shell to `zsh`

- Shells
  - **Bash (Bourne Again Shell)**
    - default for most Linux distributions
    - in the middle of completing a command, tab key automatically completes the command or gives suggestions
    - keeps a history file & logs all commands
      - `history` displays all previous commands
  - **Fish (Friendly Interactive Shell)**
    - very simple syntax & auto spell correction for commands
    - limited scripting features
  - **Zsh (Z Shell)**
    - modern shell with tab completion & command history functionality
    - capable of writing scripts
    - extensive customization makes it slower than other shells

# Modules

- `HTTPServer`
  - `python3 -m http.server` to start server using module
  - serves on a specific port from machine's IP

# Package Management

- `apt`
  - manages software packages on Debian-based systems (e.g. Ubuntu)
  - automatically handles dependencies and retrieves packages from online repo
  - common commands:
    - `sudo apt update` â€“ updates local package index
    - `sudo apt upgrade` â€“ upgrades all upgradable packages
    - `sudo apt install <pkg>` â€“ installs specified package
    - `sudo apt remove <pkg>` â€“ removes specified package (keeps config)
    - `sudo apt purge <pkg>` â€“ removes package and its config files
    - `sudo apt autoremove` â€“ cleans up unused packages


# Files & Directories

- `/etc`
  - important root directory
  - commonplace location to store system files
  - **`sudoers.d`**: contains a list of users & groups that have permission to run sudo
  - **`passwd`** & **`shadow`**: shows how the system stores passwords for each user encrypted in sha512
- `/var`
  - stores data frequently accessed / written by services / applications
    - e.g. `/var/log/` - log files from running services / apps
- `/root`
  - home directory for the "root" system user
- `/tmp`
  - volatile and used to store data that only needs to be accessed once or twice
  - contents cleared out once computer restarts
  - **any user can write to this folder by default**; good place to store things like enumeration scripts
