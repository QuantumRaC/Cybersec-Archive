# Tools & Packages

- gobuster: https://github.com/OJ/gobuster
    - *tool for bruteforcing websites Directory/File, DNS and VHost written in Go*
    - e.g.          gobuster dns -d google.com -w ~/wordlists/subdomains.txt -i
    - e.g.          gobuster dir -u https://buffered.io -w ~/wordlists/shortlist.txt

- **WireShark**
  - an open-source cross-platform network packet analyser tool capable of investigating live traffic and inspecting packet captures (PCAP)
  - can detect & troubleshoot network problems, detect security anomalies, investigate & learn protocol details
  - not an IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
  - https://tryhackme.com/room/wiresharkthebasics
  - each packet consists of 5~7 layers (OSI Model)
  - searching packets:
    - need to know input type (Display filter, Hex, String, Regex) (case sensitivity can be toggled) & search field (packet list, packet details, packet bytes)

## Package Management Concepts

- **APT (Advanced Package Tool)**
  - package management system used by Debian-based Linux distributions
  - allows users to install, update, and remove software while resolving dependencies automatically
  - fetches packages from online repositories defined in system config files
  - see related commands in [linux_notes.md â€“ apt](linux_notes.md#package-management)
  - **GPG Keys (GNU Privacy Guard)**
    - cryptographic keys used to verify the authenticity of software packages and repositories
    - APT checks repository signatures against trusted GPG keys before allowing installations
    - missing or invalid GPG keys can cause APT to reject package updates with errors like `NO_PUBKEY`
  
- **Adding a package from a third-party repository (APT workflow):**
  1. **Add GPG key** to trust the source  
     `wget -qO - <key-url> | sudo apt-key add -`
  2. **Add repository** to `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/`  
     (e.g., write a `deb https://...` line to a new `.list` file)
  3. **Update package index**  
     `sudo apt update` â€” fetches the latest package info from the new repo
  4. **Install the package**  
     `sudo apt install <package-name>`
  - `apt update` only refreshes package info â€” it does **not install** anything.


# Cyptography

- **AES (Advanced Encryption System)**: ==TODO==

# Cybersecurity Terms

## Industry Terms and Systems

- **Security Operations Center (SOC)**: 
    - a team that monitors the networks and its systemts to detect malicious cybersecurity events

- **DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response)**:
    - covers:
    - **Digital Forensics**: analyzing evidence of an attack and its perpetrators
      - file systems, system memory, system logs, network logs, etc.
    - **Incident Response**: the methodology that should be followed to handle cyber attacks
      - Preparation -> Detection and Analysis -> Containment, Eradication, and Recovery -> Post-Incident Activity

- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**:
  - a system that collects, aggregates, and analyzes log data from across systems and apps
  - helps identify abnormal or sus behavior and supports alerting and forensics analysis
    

## Adversarial Techniques

- **Malware**: malicious software, has many types:
  - **Virus**: a piece of code that attaches itself to a program
    - designed to spread from one computer to another and works by altering, overwriting and deleting files once it infects
  - **Trojan Horse**: a program that shows a desirable function but hides a malicious function underneath
  - **Ransomware**: encrypts user's files, making the files unreadable without knowing the encryption password
    - attacker offers to unlock with a ransom
  
## Security Assessment Methods

- **Static Analysis**: a security assessment of inspecting the malware without running it
- **Dynamic Analysis**: runs the malware in a controlled environment and monitors its activities

# Computer Terms & System Basics

- **Processes**
  - OS uses namespaces to split up resources (CPU, RAM, priority)
  - only processes that are in the same namespace can see each other
  - for linux see [linux process commands](linux_notes.md#processes)
  - **PID**: unique identifier assigned to each running process in a system
    - usually sequential order but can be recycled
  - e.g. `systemd` command (system's init on Ubuntu) has PID 1; every thing that starts is a child process of `systemd`
  - *when executing scripts, `Ctrl+Z` can background a process.*
  - **flags**: 
    -  Main States:
       - `R`: **Running** â€“ process is on the CPU or ready to run  
       - `S`: **Sleeping** â€“ waiting for an event (e.g., I/O)  
       - `D`: **Uninterruptible sleep** â€“ waiting for disk/I/O, can't be killed  
       - `T`: **Stopped** â€“ paused by job control or debugger  
       - `Z`: **Zombie** â€“ finished but not cleaned up by parent  
       - `X`: **Dead** â€“ defunct (very rare)
    - Additional Flags:
      - `+`: **Foreground** process group  
      - `<`: **High priority** (negative nice value)  
      - `N`: **Low priority** (positive nice value)  
      - `L`: **Pages locked** into memory  
      - `s`: **Session leader** (e.g., shell)  
      - `l`: **Multi-threaded** process  
      - `E`: **Being debugged** (traced)

- **cron / crontab**
  - `cron`: a time-based job scheduler daemon that runs tasks automatically at specified times or intervals
  - `crontab` (cron table): the *config file* where recurring tasks are defined using a *5-field time format followed by the command*
  - Fields (in order): minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week
  - See command details and formatting in [linux cron section](linux_notes.md#crontab)
